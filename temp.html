    <span class="desc">
        Growing up, I've always been fascinated with computers. It started with games 
        as a distraction which quickly cultivated into an obsession. Coming into college,
        I knew that my area of focus would be something in regards of technology. I've always
        had the urge to create and design things. I enjoy seeing the results which is why
        coding is fascinating to me. I plan on attaining my Bachelors in Computer Scienece 
        from Virginia Tech in 2023 and Master in 2024.
